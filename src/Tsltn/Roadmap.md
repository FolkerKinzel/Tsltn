## Roadmap

### 2.6
- [x] Dependency update.
- [x] Bugfix in XmlFragmentBeautifier.
- [x] Extras -> Change Source File: Initial directory should be the current source file 
directory.
- [x] Extras -> Change Source File: Initial file name should be the current file name without path.
- [x] After changing the source file the  FileSystemWatcher should watch the new source file.
- [x] When the source file has been changed several times outside of TSLTN only one MessageBox
should be displayed.
- [x] After searching an entry and jumping to begin afterwards, moving forward gives not the 
second node of the file but the previous search result.


### 2.7
- [ ] Try using TextBoxes with scroll bars for translations in Browse All Translations.
- [ ] Try to have a bigger line height in the translations text box.
- [ ] Put a GridSplitter between Original and translation.
