# The list contains comma separated tuples of type and member references
# in the code file comments that have to be replaced with entries like in the
# Visual Studio XML comments file (or the TSLTN file). The replacements are 
# performed in the order of this list.
#
# Format: CodeFileEntry,Replacement
#
# NOTE: - Types MUST include the closing double quotes: cref="Type",cref="T:NameSpace.Type"
#       - White space in the part cref=" is NOT allowed
#       - The parameter list of methods which don't have different overloads can be omitted in
#         the source files. Provide different versions in this order:
#
#         NameSpace.Method(),<Replacement>
#         Method(),<Replacement>
#         NameSpace.Method,<Replacement>
#         Method,<Replacement>
#     
#	      (Parts of these can be omitted if they don't occur in the source file, but don't change
#          the order.)
