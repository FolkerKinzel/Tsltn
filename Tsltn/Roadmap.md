## Roadmap

### 2.6
- [ ] Extras -> Change Source File: Initial directory should be the current source file directory.
- [ ] After searching an entry and jumping to begin afterwards, moving forward gives not the 
second node of the file but the previous search result.
- [ ] Try using TextBoxes with scroll bars for translations in Browse All Translations.
