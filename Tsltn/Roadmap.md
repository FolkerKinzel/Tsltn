## Roadmap

### 2.6
- [ ] Extras -> Change Source File: Initial directory should be the current source file 
directory.
- [ ] After changing the source file the  FileSystemWatcher should watch the new source file.
- [ ] After searching an entry and jumping to begin afterwards, moving forward gives not the 
second node of the file but the previous search result.
- [ ] Try using TextBoxes with scroll bars for translations in Browse All Translations.
- [ ] Try to have a bigger line height in the translations text box.
- [ ] Put a GridSplitter between Original and translation.
